### But really, wtf is this?

Inspired by [this blog post](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/writing-next-generation-reusable-javascript-modules/)

As a proof-of-concept I have set up tests using Mocha and Ava. I haven't written all the Mocha tests - Ava is what I used as I wanted an excuse to learn it.

### Transpile

```
gulp build
```

### Run the tests

```
npm test        // Ava tests are default
npm run mocha
```

You don't need to `gulp` before running the Ava tests but you do for Mocha ones.
